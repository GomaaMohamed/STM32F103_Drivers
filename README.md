# STM32F103-Drivers
## Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) for STM32F103
```
This is a collection of device driver libraries for the STM32F103 microcontroller.
The libraries provide low-level access to various hardware peripherals and features of the microcontroller,
such as SYSTICK, NVIC, RCC, GPIO, AFIO, ADC, EXTI, Timers, UART, SPI, FPEC, DMA, CAN, etc.
```
## Installation
```
To use these device drivers in your STM32F103 project, simply download the source code or clone 
this repository. You can then include the necessary header files and source files in your
code and link against the compiled library.
```
## Usage
#### To use the device drivers provided by these libraries, follow these steps:
```
>> Initialize the necessary hardware peripherals using the provided initialization 
   functions (e.g., RCC_Init, GPIO_Init, STK_Init, etc.).
>> Use the various functions provided by the libraries to interact with the hardware
   peripherals (e.g., GPIO_voidSetPinDirection, NVIC_voidEnableInterrupt, RCC_voidEnableClock, etc.).
>> Be sure to properly configure and manage interrupts using the provided
   functions (e.g., NVIC_voidEnableInterrupt, EXTI_Init, etc.).
>> When you are finished using the device drivers, be sure to disable any interrupts and
   resources that were enabled by the libraries.
```
## Configuration
```
>> The libraries provide configuration options that allow you to customize the behavior of the
   device drivers. For example, you can configure the GPIO pins as input or output, or configure
   the Timers to use a specific clock source and prescaler.
>> To configure the libraries, you can modify the configuration files (MOD_config.h ) to define the
   appropriate configuration macros. Alternatively, you can define the macros directly in your code
   before including the relevant header files.
